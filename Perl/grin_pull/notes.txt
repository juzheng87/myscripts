# Update 12/15/2015
GRIN search updated their website and now the URL uses "Accession ID" (a number) other than "Plant ID" (PI number) in the end to retreaive a website. So I updated the perl script using "Accession ID" to search.

1. First you need to get the "Accession ID" using the PI number (select "allow multiple lines" to search multiple accessions and make sure there is a blank line in the end, otherwise the last one will not be searched)

2. Using the "Accession ID" for input of the perl script
